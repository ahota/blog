I've been trying to learn Blender on and off over the last year or so. I'm not
very good, but I'm progressing slowly. Something in particular I'm interested
in making is 3D terrain, specifically procedurally generated 3D terrain.  What
I'd like is to generate a terrain that I can use in another application I
develop at work.  There are plenty of tutorials on creating terrain in Blender -
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrMee2gcS20 "Procedural Landscapes in
Blender 2.80, Wayward Art Company") one in particular is a good one.

However, what I've noticed is that these tutorials are mainly for creating a
landscape viewed from afar. If you were to fly up close to these terrains, the
visual quality breaks down. The textures are blurry and the mesh looks blocky
or jagged. But I realize I'm thinking about this in a different way from what
these tutorials teach. They are to generate an *image*, not to generate a
*model*.

looks okay at a distance, closeups are not convincing.*

I realize applications like TerraGen, World Creator, or World Machine are more
appropriate for what I'm trying to do. But those aren't free! So I'm going to keep
going with Blender and see how far I can get.
