      <p>i'm a husband and a dad. i'm a software engineer working with 3d
      graphics.</p>

      <p>i like listening to power metal, synthwave, and trance, and trap music
      (and many other genres and subgenres (and that does include country
      sometimes)). while working, i prefer music without lyrics.</p>

      <p>i like writing code, though i almost never do it as a pastime
      anymore. the main languages i use day-to-day are c++, python,
      javascript, and a decent amount of shell scripting. i use vim for all
      of it. i like tmux for keeping work organized, especially on remote
      machines. i like nomachine to get a gui for my local workstations.</p>

      <p>i like watching movies. some of my favorite genres are superhero,
      action/adventure, martial arts, comedy, and thriller.</p>

      <p>i really like rendering images of cars. i'm into 3d modeling, though
      i mostly prefer creating materials and setting up shots. i'm not too
      great at actually modeling. i only know how to use blender.</p>

      <p>i like doing diy projects around the house. though there isn't
      always time to get things done as quickly as i'd like.</p>
