    <h2>father's day</h2>

    <p>20 june 2023</p>

    <p>this past sunday was my first father's day. it was a lot of fun! i got
    to wear matching shirts with my daughter, she gave me a handwritten card
    (with help from her mom), and i got a huge texas-sized donut. i spent the
    day doing mostly nothing and watching movies with my family.</p>

    <p>it was a good time to reflect, too. it's hard to think that two years
    ago, we were living blissfully unaware of how much our lives were about
    to change. looking back at photos, everything feels like it was a
    lifetime ago. pregnancy, the birth of our daugther, and the months since
    have been so chock full of memories (and stress), that life before feels
    like a fuzzy half-remembered dream.</p>

    <p>i wouldn't change a thing, though. you hear it everywhere, especially
    when people find out you're about to have a child, that there's nothing
    like it. you get all kinds of (often unsolicited) advice, many times
    contradictory. and sometimes the advice is just ... bad. the kind of bad
    that makes you really wonder about that person.</p>

    <p>but i found that, of all the advice we got, the only one that really
    resonated and feels applicable to us is what i heard from my previous
    manager:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>the best advice i can give you is no advice. nothing i say, nothing
    anyone says, would apply to your unique circumstances. but i know you'll
    figure it out.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and truthfully, that's the only piece of advice i remember (well,
    except for one _really_ bad piece of advice to put whiskey on a baby's
    gums to help them sleep. yikes)</p>

    <p>it has been a wild ride, but it has been the most amazing time of my
    life.</p>
