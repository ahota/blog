    <h2><code>~$ shmemaphores; shared memory and semaphores</code></h2>

    <p>
    TL;DR I made an example library for using semaphores to control access to
    shared memory betwen two separate processes: 
    <a href="https://github.com/ahota/shmemaphore">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    I recently had to dive into some interprocess communication (IPC) code for
    work. I had to refresh myself on the different options that are used. It has
    been about 13 or 14 years since I learned about them, and I've never needed to
    use IPC in that time.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the end, an API based on shared memory was going to be the best solution
    for me. I relearned how semaphores are used to guard access to resources. It's
    surprising to me how hard it is to find good, straightforward explanations for
    these concepts. [Beej's Guide to IPC] is the gold standard here (as well as
    pretty much everything else Beej has written). But even here I found the
    explanation of semaphores a little lackluster. The best resource I found is
    from James Madison University: a completely free textbook online of OS
    fundamentals.
    <a href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/OpenCSF/Books/csf/html/index.html">Link</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
    Here goes my own explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
    A semaphore is a locking mechanism used to control access to a resource. The
    resource can be anything you choose; it's completely separate from the
    semaphore logic.
    </p>
    <p>
    The two key points about a semaphore are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        it exists <em>independently</em> from the threads and processes that use it
      </li>
      <li>
        it can allow up to your choice of <i>n</i> concurrent users of the resource
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    You can think of a semaphore as a file (which is usually how it's
    implemented) that is "owned" by the operating system. That means semaphores
    are completely independent of the threads/processes using them, and can even
    exist after program execution ends. In fact, they will exist until system
    shutdown unless you destroy them yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
    Using a semaphore was necessary in my case because I'm using two completely
    unrelated processes; one doesn't launch the other and consequently share or
    copy memory space, nor are they threads forked from a parent. Because the OS
    holds the semaphore, I can access them from both processes. Awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
    In essence, a semaphore is just an integer. The value of the integer dictates
    how many processes can access the resource being guarded. Any time a process
    wants to access the resource, either to read or write, it must "acquire" one
    of the slots. This is actually called <i>waiting</i>, which I think is a dumb
    term. I also dislike all the other alternative terms (<i>downing</i>
    (which almost sounds offensive) or <i>P</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
    If the semaphore's value is greater than 0, the process can pass through. The
    semaphore's value is then decremented to show that slot is taken. When the
    process is done accessing the resource, it "releases" the semaphore. This is
    called <i>posting</i>, a term which I also dislike (along with <i>upping</i>,
    <i>signaling</i>, or <i>V</i>). Posting increments the semaphore's value,
    showing that a slot is now free.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the semaphore's value is 0, then the resource is being accessed by the max
    number of processes. When a process attempts to decrement the semaphore, it
    will be blocked. The process will wait (this is where the name comes from)
    until another process is finished and increments the semaphore.
    </p>
    <p>
    That's it! But the real challenge is using them effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
    Beej's guide, and many tutorials online, use System V semaphores. These are
    rather outdated, and aren't as widely supported as the alternative: POSIX
    semaphores.  You can create named and unnamed (or anonymous) semaphores.
    Unnamed semaphores, however, can only be shared between threads using the same
    memory space (e.g. parent and child), or have to be placed in a shared memory
    segment to access by separate processes. This is annoying, because a shared
    memory segment is what I'm using the semaphore to guard in the first place.
    Unnamed semaphores are also completely unsupported on some OSs (e.g.
    macOS/BSD). So they're just not a good choice. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Using the POSIX methods to create, use, and destroy semaphores isn't _so_ bad.
    But it does come with the usual tedium of checking error codes every other
    line so commonly found in C. I also found that because semaphore
    implementations are OS-specific, there's no good way to reference a semaphore
    by name without hard-coding the name. For example, destroying a semaphore
    requires the name, but the semaphore itself doesn't know its own name; so you
    have to separately keep track of it. That's kind of annoying, so I wrote a thin
    C++ wrapper class to simplify access a little.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have the same gripes for shared memory. It's just tedious to use via C.
    But I guess that's the price you pay for stable, time-tested code. Either way
    I threw together another thin C++ wrapper class for it too.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm getting a little tired of writing this, even though I do have more to say.
    I'll come back for a part two, hopefully soon. I leave you with my example
    code: <a href="https://github.com/ahota/shmemaphore">GitHub</a>.
