      <em>The Apple Car is dead: a post-mortem jocularity, if you will</em>

      You pat yourself on the back for getting the optional charging cable for
      your Apple Car.  Even though it cost as much as your down payment, it was
      worth it because you had forgotten to charge it yesterday and now the
      battery is low.  You unspool your Lightning Max cable from its reel on
      the wall and plug it into the underside of your Apple Car.  Thankfully
      Apple made the thinnest and lightest car so one person, like yourself,
      can rock Apple Car back and forth until it flips over to reveal the
      single charge port under the chassis.  <em>It makes sense</em>, you
      think, <em>that Apple didn't put the charging port in a "typical" spot;
      what if you accidentally drove away with the cable connected? </em>
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>What a disaster that would be</em>, you chuckle to yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
      You wait for half an hour for Apple Car to reach 50% charge.  You're late
      for dinner with your girlfriend; she wants to introduce you to her
      parents.  Now you'll be fashionably late, which should give you an air of
      sophistication when you walk in.  While waiting, you wipe dirt off the
      brushed aluminum body, admiring its sheen.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>It's really a work of art</em>, you think.
      </p>

      <p>
      You pull the Lightning Max cable out and respool it.  You notice the
      cable is starting to bend and fray at the end where it meets the
      connector.  <em>Apple probably does that so you don't use the cable for
      too long and wear it out</em>, you think.  You begin rocking your Apple
      Car back and forth to flip it back over.  You hear a loud, sharp,
      <em>clink</em> as you give it a final push.  Your Apple Car lands on its
      wheels and you see the windshield had rolled over a pebble and is now
      cracked, fine lines snaking across the glass.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>Damn it</em>, you think to yourself, <em>I should've bought a
        case</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      You stare at your Apple Car's window as FaceID scans you.  The door pops
      open and you hop inside.  You settle into the single, cushy white seat in
      the hyper-minimal interior.  You tap the Apple DashPad to wake it up; it
      scans your face and unlocks.  You open Apple Maps and type in your
      girlfriend's parents' address.  You tap the navigation start button and
      Apple AirPilot takes over.  Apple Car backs out of your driveway and,
      unbeknownst to you, begins taking you to a random incorrect location.
      </p>

      <p>
      As you pull out of your neighborhood, you swipe up to leave Apple Maps
      and bring up the news app on your Apple DashPad.  You scroll through
      headlines as you silently zip down the main road outside your
      neighborhood.
      </p>

      <p>
      <blockquote>
      Lucid unveils its next EV, the Lucid Earth, following the success of its
      previous models, the Air, Fire, and Water.  Lucid claims the Earth will
      travel over 1000 miles on a single charge, with a 0-60 time of 0.88
      seconds.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      <em>Ha</em>, you think, <em>They're always trying to compete on
        range</em>.  Apple Car has a 200-mile range on a full charge.  <em>But
        they're <strong>premium</strong> miles</em>, you think.  Plus, <em>they
      </em> show up as green boxes on the AirPilot head-up display.  Apple Cars
      show up as blue cars, and you can AirDrop memes to them.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>That's what's important</em>, you think, <em>The experience</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      As you turn onto a service road, you begin to feel a bit too warm.  The
      automatic climate control system had set the temperature to the ideal for the
      current season and weather.  Admittedly, your outfit of a black
      turtleneck and jeans is an odd choice for summer.  You decide to turn the
      temperature down.  You switch apps again, now to climate control.  Apple
      hasn't rolled out the split view update for DashPad yet, so you have not
      seen the map since you left, and therefore have not noticed you are going
      the wrong way.  You press the auto temp button to disable automatic
      climate control, then press and drag the temperature slider down.  The
      slider stops moving as you drag.  You try pressing and dragging again,
      but nothing happens.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>Maybe this is a new feature</em>, you think, <em>To prevent rapid
        temperature changes</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      A spinning beach ball appears on the DashPad.  It's one of the
      few remnants of macOS in Apple's consolidated OS ecosystem.  You keep
      tapping the screen, but nothing happens.  It's frozen.
      </p>

      <p>
      You hear a beep.  The AirPilot head-up display notifies you that AirPilot
      wants to take a toll road.  You have password protection enabled for
      purchases, so it needs FaceID to enter the on-ramp.  You stare at
      DashPad, but nothing happens.  It's still frozen.
      </p>

      <p>
      The service road is under construction ahead.  AirPilot wants to avoid it,
      but its only move is to enter the toll road.  Confused, AirPilot requests
      manual override.  You press the center of the Touch Wheel.  Haptic feedback
      from the Touch Wheel tells you the steering system still works.  But manual
      override requires FaceID, since you set this to be a single-driver car.
      You stare at the DashPad, but nothing happens.  It's still frozen.
      </p>

      <p>
      As you hurtle towards the toll road on-ramp, AirPilot gives up in its
      confusion.  Apple Car slowly drifts, now pointing directly at the concrete
      barrier between the on-ramp and service road.  The emergency braking sensors
      mercifully still work, and slam on the brakes.  Your tires screech as the
      concrete barrier grows closer.  It's going to be a close one.  Apple Car
      decelerates, you squeeze your eyes shut, and the car comes to a stop with
      just enough momentum for the nose of the car to just barely tap the concrete
      barrier.
      </p>

      <p>
      For a moment, you take in the quiet, opening your eyes.  Smoke from the
      tires wafts around Apple Car.  Then you hear a loud, sharp <em>clink</em>.
      You step out of the car.  The panoramic sunroof and rear windscreen have
      cracked, fine lines snaking across the roof of the car.

      Time to go to the Genius Garage.
