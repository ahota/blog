this past sunday was my first father's day. it was a lot of fun! i got to
wear matching shirts with my daughter, she gave me a handwritten card (with
help from her mom), and i got a huge texas-sized donut. i spent the day doing
mostly nothing and watching movies with my family.

it was a good time to reflect, too. it's hard to think that two years ago, we
were living blissfully unaware of how much our lives were about to change.
looking back at photos, everything feels like it was a lifetime ago.
pregnancy, the birth of our daugther, and the months since have been so chock
full of memories (and stress), that life before feels like a fuzzy
half-remembered dream.

i wouldn't change a thing, though. you hear it everywhere, especially when
people find out you're about to have a child, that there's nothing like it.
you get all kinds of (often unsolicited) advice, many times contradictory. and
sometimes the advice is just ... bad. the kind of bad that makes you really
wonder about that person.

but i found that, of all the advice we got, the only one that really resonated
and feels applicable to us is what i heard from my previous manager:

"the best advice i can give you is no advice. nothing i say, nothing anyone
says, would apply to your unique circumstances. but i know you'll figure it
out."

and truthfully, that's the only piece of advice i remember (well, except for
one _really_ bad piece of advice to put whiskey on a baby's gums to help them
sleep. yikes)

it has been a wild ride, but it has been the most amazing time of my life.
