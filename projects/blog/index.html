    <p>june 15 2023</p>

    <p>this might be the 10th blog i've started over the past 20 years.
    it's probably common, but i find i'll start a blog because i think to
    myself, "i should start blogging [again]." and so i do. but i quickly
    lose steam or just forget to update. and if a long enough period of
    time goes by, that blog is dead forever.</p>

    <p>i'm hoping this one will be different because it's also an
    experiment. and as a software engineer, there is nothing i like more
    than getting an idea and toying with it. i just hope i can find it in
    me to keep it going.</p>

    <p>a few years ago, i learned about the semantic web, and more
    specifically, semantic html. i liked the idea. the thought of a
    well-structured web containing and linking together well-structured
    documents, pages, images, media, etc. seems like a utopian dream of the
    original arpanet. a huge benefit of semantic html is its accessibility to
    those with visual impairments. a screen reader can much more easily
    transcribe the contents of a page that is well-structured with predictable
    components than it can read a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup. that kind of
    accessibility is important for everyone, and simply interesting to me.</p>

    <p>i also have grown to dislike the bloat of the modern web. having to
    transfer tens of megabytes just to view something is ridiculous in my
    opinion. i thankfully have a gigabit connection, so load times tend to
    be shorter (but still noticeable). but those without access to
    high-speed internet suffer the exclusion.</p>

    <p>so this blog is an experiment in creating an accessible website:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>large text</li>

      <li>well-structured pages with semantic html</li>

      <li>fast load times (i want to hold off on javascript as long as
        possible)</li>

      <li>focus on static content, not dynamic user-created content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>i'm not going to change the world, but i can at least experiment
    with how it could be done. and maybe participating myself is the best
    thing to do.</p>
