I bought some C by GE smart bulbs and a light strip for our home to use through Google Home. Although direct 
connect did work to do the initial setup, I found the lights would disconnect and be unusable through Google
Home after an hour or so. The problem is that the bulbs (and my light strip) needed to be updated, and that
didn't work through Google Home. So, to fix it:

1. Factory reset all bulbs/strips. The strips are easy; the bulbs are tedious, but not hard.
2. Set up the bulbs in the Cync app. Again, this is tedious, but not hard. The lights will all update at this point.
3. Finally, in the Cync app, go to Settings > Voice > Set up Google Home (or Alexa).

Now the lights work through Google Assistant!
